# Assignment: One HTML and CSS

For this assignment, you will clone Dr. John Monberg's wra410 repository.

You will update your README.md file so that I can learn about the changes you made.

If I can't find your changes, I can't give you credit for them

Revise the following section in your README.md file with a short description of what you've accomplished.

## Required Changes to WRA 410

1. Make changes to the background color of a page and a div.

 ~I have changed the background color of the policies page and the divs on the schedule page to green and
 white to commemorate MSU colors. I also changed the color of the text links to a darker grey to go with
 my new color scheme I have going on.

2. Use a new font.

 ~For a new font I used Papyrus because I love it and think it is a nice blend of fun and professional.

3. Include two images.

 ~The first image I added was an MSU logo on left corner of each page and the next is another logo next to each of the
 text on each page.

4. Use a table to format the Grading Scale on the Assignments page.

 ~I made a table using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK27jWKtJxs. It was very helpful and I customized to my liking.

5. Reformat the Student Groups. Use a different color for links, add a title for each group, separate each student. Use multiple columns for the divs.  

 ~I changed the color of the links to white and added in our group name. I also moved our names so they were
 more readable. I also added a grid column to the groups.

6. Add navigation to the Schedule webpage.

 ~I added a side navigation to the left on the schedule page.

7. Revise the rows and columns on the Schedule webpage so the information is clearer or prettier.

 ~I revised the rows and columns into a table to make them more neater.
